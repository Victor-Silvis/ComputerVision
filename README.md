# ComputerVision Projects
A collection of my public computervision projects. 


## Project 1: Object Detection Aircraft Turnaround
Using the YOLOv3 methodology, a fully customizable, object-based algorithm has been developed from scratch. The model is trained to analyze aircraft turnarounds using live video footage but is can be trained so it can be applied to a wide range of purposes. This code serves as a foundation for an analytical tool designed to evaluate various aspects of the aircraft turnaround process. Potential applications include real-time monitoring and timing of tasks performed around the aircraft or quality control checks, such as verifying proper cone placement or ensuring PPE compliance. The model achieves both high accuracy and real-time performance, maintaining a processing speed of 30+ FPS.

## Project 2: Parkingspot Checker
This project features a CNN-based image classifier model designed for real-time applications. The straightforward yet effective model identifies whether a parking spot is available and counts the total number of available spots. By incorporating efficiency-enhancing techniques—such as accounting for the fact that parking spot status doesn't change every second in real life—the solution becomes highly optimized. Additionally, the adaptable code can be repurposed for various other use cases, making it a versatile tool.

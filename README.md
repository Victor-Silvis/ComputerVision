# ComputerVision Projects
A collection of my public computervision projects. 

## Project 1: Object Detection Aircraft Turnaround
Using the YOLOv3 methodology, an object based algorithm has been made from scratch to analyse an aircraft turnaround from (live) video footage. However the code could be applied for all kinds of purposes. This code could form the basis for an analytical tool to analyse the aircraft turnaround. For purposes such as realtime timing of various tasks around the aircraft, or for example quality control (e.g. are cones set correctly, PPE compliance etc.)

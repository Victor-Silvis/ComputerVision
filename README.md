# ComputerVision Projects
A collection of my public computervision projects. 

## Project 1: Object Detection Aircraft Turnaround
Using the YOLOv3 methodology, an object based algorithm has been made from scratch for full customization. The model is trained to analyse an aircraft turnaround from (live) video footage. However the code could be applied for all kinds of purposes. This code could form the basis for an analytical tool to analyse the aircraft turnaround. For purposes such as realtime timing of various tasks around the aircraft, or for example quality control (e.g. are cones set correctly, PPE compliance etc.) By basing the code on the YOLO methodology, the model is not only accurate, but also easily able to be utilitized realtime (30+ FPS).

## Project 2: Parkingspot Checker
A project that includes the use of a CNN image classifier model in a realtime scenario. The simple but effective model determines wheter a parking spot is available or not and counts the amount of available spots. Combined with ways of making it as effecient (e.g. not every parking spot changes every second in reallife) makes it a very effective code that can be used for many other purposes as well.
